## Python Text Processing Homework 1

This program takes in a csv, cleans up the data, corrects format from user, pickles and un-pickles the Person object, and prints the formatted list of info from the csv.

To Run: download the .py and the data file and run in command line with the command 
'python Homework1_aae180003.py data/data.csv'.

Python has great strengths in processing with the automatic itterator in for loops. It also has a great regex library that makes it very easy to check text input from a user. It is difficult to implement functions because my ide stops recommending libaray functions outside of main because it isn't certain of parameter types.

Function and comment writing were good reviews for me. Proper implementation of input checking was a nice review. Dynamic variables seem very powerful yet I find myself defining them at the start of most functions anyway. I did learn the scope of python a lot more and that really helped.
